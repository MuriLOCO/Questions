public class Solution{
	
	public static int recursiveSum(int[] array, int index) {
		 if (index == array.length){			
			 return 0;
		 }else{
	            return array[index] + recursiveSum(array, index + 1);
	    }
	}	 
	
	public static int sum(int[] input) {
		return recursiveSum(input, 0);		
	}	
	
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		
		int[] input = {1,3,4};		
		
		System.out.println("The result is: " + sum(input));

	}

}

NOTE: In this case I would do a bit different of what the exercice is suggesting, for example, it was suggesting me to put the code inside the method but I chose to create a new method instead.
NOTE2: The "0" in the parameter is the position where the recursiveSum will start, usually it is 0 but eventually you could change to start somewhere else.

NOTE3: Answeing the question, what could go wrong is that, since the Return is the type "int", it could overflow the variable max size which is 2^31-1.
